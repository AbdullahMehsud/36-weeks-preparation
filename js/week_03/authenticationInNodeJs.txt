authentication patterens:
statefull-> which maintains state or data or server side
-> server keeps track of the users session
-> after the user logs in, the server creates a session(usually stored in memory or a database)
-> a session ID is sent back to the client, typically in cookie
-> for each request, the server checks the session ID to validate the user


stateless-> which has no state
-> the server dose not store any session data 
-> after login, the server sends back a token (usually a jwt)
-> on each request the client sends the token(typically in the authorization header)
-> the server verifies the token on every request

cookie -> auto
-> only valid for browser
